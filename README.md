# Error 522 Cloudflare

I thought it would be cool to have a service that you can make it look like someones website is down. Im also learning more javascript so this is like practice / seeing what i can do.


## What Does It Look Like?

It uses a query from the url like:
```batch
http://127.0.0.1/cloudflare?url=cjstevenson.com
```
This will then pass the url to the ejs so it can be displayed.
